## 2026-05-30 — v19.34.184 MISSION CONTROL (live multi-lane pipeline cockpit)

### What
A new top-level **Mission Control** tab: a live, always-on "cockpit" that
streams the bot's decision bus into 5 lanes — **Scanner | Gates | Execution |
Position | Reconciler** — plus a **System/Safety** strip, a heartbeat pip,
AGGREGATE/RAW scanner mode, severity filters, and click-through to a symbol's
recent-decision drawer.

### Why this design (coverage audit drove it)
A `sentcom_thoughts` audit over 7d showed the event bus already captures the
whole pipeline (~362k events), so we **reuse the existing bus** instead of
building a parallel system. Key finding: the **Scanner lane is a firehose**
(~324k `scanner_skip`/7d, peak ~600 events/min), NOT thin. So the architecture
centers on throttling that volume, not adding events.

### Performance (the operator's explicit concern: "will B slow the app?")
No — the trading hot path is untouched:
  • `StreamBus.publish()` is **synchronous, allocation-cheap, never awaits/sends**
    — a background ~300ms flush loop does the per-connection send.
  • **Zero idle overhead**: when no client is connected, `publish()` early-returns
    (after cheaply bumping the scanner roll-up counter).
  • **Scanner firehose handling (hybrid)**: in `aggregate` mode skips/rejects are
    NOT buffered — only counted and summarized via a periodic `scan_pulse`.
    `scanner_trigger` always streams. `raw` mode streams everything (buffered
    only when a raw subscriber exists). Hard `_MAX_BUFFER` load-shed on bursts.
  • **Always-on persistence**: `sentcom_thoughts` is written 24/7 regardless of
    the tab; the WS is only the live delivery channel (so nothing is lost when
    the tab is closed — reopen → backfill + resume).

### Backend
- `services/stream_bus.py` (NEW) — loop-local broadcaster + `classify_lane` /
  `severity_of` (action_type-primary, source/kind tie-breakers).
- `services/sentcom_service.py` — `emit_stream_event` now fans out to the bus
  (sync, fail-open).
- `server.py` — `@app.websocket("/api/ws/stream")` with subscribe (lanes +
  severities + mode), 20s keepalive, graceful disconnect.
- **New lane emits**: v183 guards (`wrong_side_stop_recomputed`,
  `position_stop_capped`) → Gates lane (live proof they fire); `target_hit`
  scale-out → Position lane.

### Frontend
- `pages/MissionControlPage.jsx` (NEW) — orchestrator (backfill + live tail).
- `hooks/useStreamSocket.js` (NEW) — WS client, backoff reconnect, sub push.
- `lib/laneClassify.js` (NEW) — client mirror of the server classifier (backfill).
- `components/missioncontrol/{StreamRow,LaneColumn,TrailDrawer}.jsx` (NEW).
- `App.js` + `Sidebar.js` — new "Mission Control" nav tab (Radio icon).

### Verification
- 14 stream-bus unit tests (lane classify, severity, firehose aggregate/raw,
  per-connection flush filter, scan_pulse). 48/48 across v169/v181/v182/v183/v184.
- **Live WS handshake verified** on the local backend (connect → lane-filtered
  subscribe → ping/pong).
- Frontend: lint clean, compiles with no module errors; smoke screenshot shows
  5 lanes + System strip + heartbeat + AGGREGATE/RAW + severity filters
  rendering (IDLE in the mirror — no REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL/live data; connects
  live on the DGX).
- Deploy patch: https://paste.rs/21jcv (14 files), `git apply --check` clean on
  v183 tree (DGX HEAD 7863a27d).

### Follow-ups (deferred, noted)
- More lifecycle emits (stop→breakeven, trailing-stop move, order_submitted,
  partial_fill, EOD-flatten-initiated) to further enrich Position/Execution.
- Inline "acknowledge" action on System/Safety alarms (currently click-through
  to the recent-decision drawer only).
- ⚠️ OPERATOR LIVE-CHECK: open Mission Control on the DGX during RTH — heartbeat
  should go LIVE, Scanner pulse should tick (triggers/skips/rejects), Gates
  should fill with rejection reasons; flip RAW to see the skip firehose.

## 2026-05-30 — v19.34.183 STOP-GEOMETRY SANITY (squeeze stale-trigger + evaluator guards)

### Why (found while validating v182 gameplan accuracy — now visible, not hidden)
With v182 surfacing real alert levels, three live alerts exposed bad stop
geometry: DIA `squeeze` long had `stop 505.82 ABOVE entry 501.63` (inverted),
and BMO `stage_2_breakout` carried a 16.8% structural stop. Root cause traced:
the alert dict maps `stop_price = alert.stop_loss`, and the evaluator only
recomputes a stop when one is MISSING (`if not stop_price`) — so detector
stops flow straight into sizing/brackets, inverted or over-wide.

### Bugs fixed
1. **DIA squeeze stale trigger (detector).** `_check_squeeze` set
   `trigger_price = bb_upper` (long) but anchored stop/target to *current
   price*. Once price has already broken out and run past the band, bb_upper
   is stale and an ATR stop (current_price − 1·ATR) lands ABOVE it → inverted
   long. Fix: anchor entry to `max(bb_upper, current_price)` (long) /
   `min(bb_lower, current_price)` (short), and compute stop+target+R:R off that
   single consistent `entry`. Normal pre-breakout case unchanged (entry =
   band). Option (i): fix the geometry, do NOT suppress the signal.
2. **Inverted stop reaches sizer (evaluator, defense-in-depth).** New wrong-side
   guard right after the stop resolve: if a long's stop ≥ entry (or short's
   stop ≤ entry), discard it and recompute via `calculate_atr_based_stop`
   (always correct-side). Catches ALL ~38 detectors, not just squeeze.
3. **v169 5% stop-cap bypassed for detector stops (evaluator).** v169's
   position/investment 5%-of-entry cap lives inside `calculate_atr_based_stop`,
   which only runs when no stop is supplied. stage_2_breakout / weekly_breakout
   supply their own wide structural stops, bypassing it → reopened the "1–3
   share" tiny-sizing problem. New cap applies the same 5% ceiling (env
   `MAX_STOP_PCT_POSITION` / `MAX_STOP_PCT_INVESTMENT`) to detector-supplied
   stops on position/investment horizons. Only TIGHTENS; never loosens.

### Not bugs (confirmed working)
- BOXX `three_week_tight` R:R 0.60 → v181 auto-ladder re-derives the target to
  clear the swing R:R floor. Working as designed.
- `LiveAlert.atr` persisting as 0.0 in diagnostics is a cosmetic display gap
  (detector used a real ATR ~5.1) — left as a future nit.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/enhanced_scanner.py` (`_check_squeeze` entry anchor)
- `backend/services/opportunity_evaluator.py` (wrong-side guard + detector stop-cap)
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_183_stop_geometry.py` (new, 10 tests)

### Verification
- 10/10 new tests pass (3 exercise the REAL `_check_squeeze`; 7 mirror the
  evaluator guard logic). 62/62 across v169+v181+v179+v112+v182+v183 — no
  regressions. Both services compile; lint clean on the edited regions.
- Deploy patch: paste.rs URL provided in chat (3 files).
- Path touched is the ENTRY/sizing path, not the safety-critical close path.
- ⚠️ OPERATOR LIVE-CHECK: next session, grep `/tmp/backend.log` for
  `v19.34.183 wrong-side-stop` / `v19.34.183 stop-cap` to confirm the guards
  fire; confirm position-tier setups (stage_2_breakout) now size with sane
  share counts instead of 1–3.

## 2026-05-30 — v19.34.182 GAMEPLAN DATA-ACCURACY FIXES

### Why (operator confirmed live: stocks_in_play=0, empty key levels, $0 stops)
`gameplan_service._auto_populate_game_plan` had three data-accuracy bugs that
made the V5 Gameplan/Briefing card show blank/zero data — a hard prerequisite
for F-F (wiring premarket intelligence into the bot's prioritization).

### Bugs fixed
1. **$0 stops/targets** — entries read `getattr(alert,'stop_price')` /
   `'target_price'`, which don't exist on the `LiveAlert` dataclass (canonical
   fields are `stop_loss` / `target`). Every stop/target rendered as $0.
2. **Swing/position setups dropped** — `daily_alerts` (scan_tier swing/position)
   were computed then NEVER appended to `stocks_in_play`. Now appended (deduped)
   between the premarket and intraday tiers.
3. **Empty key levels** — `big_picture.key_levels` was never populated. Now
   filled with SPY/QQQ support+resistance (realtime technical service,
   `mongo_only=True`) and VIX (regime engine `volume_vix.signals.vix_price`).
4. **(bonus) Day-2 strict date−1** — looked up `date - 1 day`, landing on
   weekends/holidays with no plan (zero Day-2 names every Monday). Now queries
   the most recent PRIOR game plan (`{"date": {"$lt": date}}` sort desc).
5. **(bonus) reasoning List[str]** — coerced to text via `_reasoning_text`
   (was stored as a list / sliced as a list in if_then notes).

### Refactor
Extracted the duplicated entry-building into `_alert_to_stock_entry(alert,
source)` (single correct field mapping, used by all 3 tiers) + `_reasoning_text`
helper + `_populate_key_levels` helper. All best-effort / fail-open.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/gameplan_service.py`
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_182_gameplan_accuracy.py` (new, 8 tests)

### Verification
- 8/8 new unit tests pass (pure logic; no DB/IB needed); 14/14 with the
  existing gameplan-narrative suite. Lint clean. Patch verified to `git apply
  --check` cleanly on the v181 tree (DGX HEAD 8f21c0f6).
- Deploy patch: https://paste.rs/i5pbj (gameplan_service.py + test).
- ⚠️ RUNTIME NOTE: `GET /journal/gameplan/today` only re-creates the plan when
  none exists for today. To see the fix on a day where a (buggy) plan already
  exists, delete today's `game_plans` row OR call `POST /journal/gameplan
  ?auto_populate=true` to regenerate. Tomorrow's open is clean automatically.

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.181 OPENING-VOLATILITY TIME GATE + R:R AUTO-LADDER FALLBACK

### Why (operator-driven, from live 10:05 ET scanner review)
1. Swing/position/investment/multi-day setups were firing in the opening 30
   min — operator wants them gated to **10:15 ET+** (scalp/intraday stay
   all-day). Root cause: `_is_setup_valid_now` only blocks setups LISTED in
   `STRATEGY_TIME_WINDOWS`; none of the longer-horizon setups were listed, so
   the gate returned True (all-day) for them.
2. Longer-horizon setups were almost all rejected at the `min_risk_reward`
   gate at absurd R:R (BIL 0.02, BOXX 0.03, stage_2 0.57-0.76). Root cause:
   their detectors supply their OWN targets (set near daily structure, close
   to entry) paired with wide 2.5-3× ATR stops → R:R ≪ 1. The auto R-ladder
   only ran when NO targets were supplied, so it never rescued them.

### Fixes shipped
- **Time gate (enhanced_scanner):** new `LATER_HORIZON_STYLES`
  {swing, position, investment, multi_day} + `LATER_HORIZON_START_ET=(10,15)`.
  `_later_horizon_window_ok(alert)` blocks those styles before 10:15 ET; wired
  right after `_check_setup` so it gates on the alert's FINAL `trade_style`
  (an intraday-classified `squeeze` correctly stays all-day even though
  STRATEGY_CONFIG tags it swing). Scalp/intraday/unknown pass any time.
  Fail-open.
- **R:R auto-ladder fallback (opportunity_evaluator):** extracted the v112
  trade-style ladder into `_target_ladder_rungs(alert, setup_type)` (behavior
  identical). At the R:R gate, when a detector-supplied target yields
  sub-threshold R:R, re-derive the target from the ACTUAL per-share risk using
  the ladder, picking the smallest rung that clears `effective_min_rr`
  (swing→2.5R, position→2R), leaving the stop untouched. Only applies if the
  recomputed R:R actually clears the floor; otherwise rejects as before.
  Logs `🪜 ... auto-ladder fallback`.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/enhanced_scanner.py`
- `backend/services/opportunity_evaluator.py`
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_112_scalp_sl_tp_fix.py` (anchored to new helper)
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_181_timegate_and_rr_fallback.py` (new, 8 tests)

### Verification
- 8 new tests pass; 121/121 across all ladder/RR/exposure/TQS/prioritization
  suites green; both services compile.
- Live (post-deploy): R:R fallback verifiable now (`grep "auto-ladder fallback"
  /tmp/backend.log`; longer-horizon setups should start clearing the R:R gate).
  Time gate verifiable at TOMORROW's open (no swing/pos/inv/m-day alerts before
  10:15 ET; they appear at 10:15).
- ⚠️ Deploy restarts the backend mid-session → account-guard re-trips
  (re-acknowledge once account chip is green) and open positions get re-adopted
  by the reconciler. Prefer deploying when flat / after close.

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.180 PUT /risk-params now persists MONGO_WINS fields

### Why
During v179 ops, setting `max_open_positions=25` via `POST /api/trading-bot/risk-params`
returned 25 in-memory but `effective-limits` kept reading 10. Root cause: the
endpoint persists via a fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task(_save_state())`,
which races the `state_integrity` watchdog. `max_open_positions` (and 5 other
limits) are `MONGO_WINS`, so the watchdog reverted in-memory 25 back to the
stale Mongo 10 before the deferred save landed. The operator's API change
silently didn't stick (had to write Mongo directly + force-resync).

### Fix
`trading_bot_service.update_risk_params` now writes any updated `MONGO_WINS`
fields **synchronously** to `bot_state.risk_params.*` before the async save.
Sync pymongo is safe here — the method runs from a sync FastAPI route
(threadpool), not the event loop. Affects: `max_open_positions`,
`max_position_pct`, `max_daily_loss_pct`, `min_risk_reward`,
`reconciled_default_stop_pct`, `reconciled_default_rr`. MEMORY_WINS fields
(`starting_capital`, `setup_min_rr`, etc.) are intentionally excluded.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/trading_bot_service.py` (update_risk_params sync persist)
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_180_risk_params_sync_persist.py` (new, 4 tests)

### Verification
- 4/4 unit tests pass; file compiles.
- Live (post-deploy): `POST /risk-params {max_open_positions:24}` → effective
  reads 24 with NO manual Mongo write or resync; restore to 25 confirmed.
- Ops note: live max_open_positions raised 10 → 25 (kill switch already 25).

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.179 PRIORITIZATION + SLOT ALLOCATION + EXPOSURE + POS-CAP

### Why
Read-only audit of premarket prep / trade prioritization / scalp time-decay
surfaced four concrete defects. Fixed all four + the operator's
`max_open_positions` alignment question.

### Fixes shipped
- **F-A — inverted alert priority sort (P0)**. `enhanced_scanner.get_live_alerts`
  used `sort(key=(priority_order, created_at), reverse=True)` with
  `priority_order={CRITICAL:0…LOW:3}`, so `reverse=True` flipped the bucket
  order and **CRITICAL/HIGH alerts sorted LAST**. The bot intake
  (`_get_trade_alerts` → `[:20]` → slot fill) burned its position slots on
  LOW-priority alerts first and could truncate CRITICAL off the end. Replaced
  with a **stable two-pass sort** (recency desc, then priority asc) → CRITICAL
  first, newest-first within bucket. Proven: pre-fix order
  `[LOW,MED,HIGH,CRIT]`; post-fix `[CRIT_new,CRIT_old,HIGH,MED,LOW]`. The same
  file already used the correct convention at L1115 (CRITICAL=4) — confirming
  `get_live_alerts` was the outlier.
- **F-B — quality-ranked slot allocation**. `_get_trade_alerts` returned
  `alerts[:20]` in scanner order with no quality ranking. Added `_alert_rank`
  (priority bucket → tqs_score → trigger_probability → score, all desc) before
  the slice so the scarce `max_open_positions` slots go to the BEST ideas.
- **F-C — portfolio exposure caps now apply to autopilot**. The v96/98
  position-style (30%) + long-horizon (55%) caps via
  `portfolio_exposure_guard.compute_exposure` were wired ONLY into the manual
  `submit_trade` router path. Unattended bot entries could pile simultaneous
  long-horizon bets past the intended concentration (starving scalp/intraday
  buying power). Mirrored the clamp into `opportunity_evaluator.evaluate_opportunity`
  (autonomous path), right after final sizing: clamps shares to the remaining
  cap room, or rejects (`reason_code="portfolio_exposure_cap"`) when saturated.
  Fail-open. Per-symbol (v123) cap still applies independently.
- **F-E — morning-readiness false YELLOW**. `morning_readiness_service` expected
  EOD at 15:55; canonical is 15:45 (v181). Widened the accepted band to
  15:40–15:58 so the daily autopilot check stops throwing a spurious YELLOW.

### max_open_positions alignment (operator question — "isn't it 25 now?")
- **Code default bumped 10 → 25** (`RiskParameters.max_open_positions`). This is
  only the fallback; the LIVE value is Mongo `bot_state.risk_params.max_open_positions`.
- **Intake gate now uses the EFFECTIVE cap** = `min(bot value,
  SAFETY_MAX_POSITIONS)`. Previously the scan-loop intake (`:4097`) used the
  bot value alone while the kill switch enforced the min — so a bot=25 /
  kill-switch=5 config wasted evaluation on trades that would be blocked at
  execution. Gate can now only TIGHTEN (strictly safe).
- ⚠️ OPERATOR ACTION: the binding cap is `min(bot, SAFETY_MAX_POSITIONS)`. The
  kill-switch env default is **5**. If you want 25 live, set BOTH:
    - Mongo: `db.bot_state.updateOne({_id:"bot_state"},{$set:{"risk_params.max_open_positions":25}})`
    - DGX env: `SAFETY_MAX_POSITIONS=25` (then restart). Confirm via
      `GET /api/trading-bot/effective-limits` → `effective.max_open_positions`.

### F-D — scalp time-decay tagging audit (read-only script)
`backend/scripts/audit_scalp_timeframe_tagging_v19_34_179.py`. `check_scalp_decay`
only fires for `timeframe=="scalp"`, which is set from
`STRATEGY_CONFIG[setup_type]["timeframe"]` (default INTRADAY). Any scalp detector
missing/mis-tagged silently never time-decays (closes only at EOD). Run on DGX:
`DB_NAME=tradecommand python -m backend.scripts.audit_scalp_timeframe_tagging_v19_34_179`
→ prints mismatches; if any, add/correct the setup's STRATEGY_CONFIG timeframe.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/enhanced_scanner.py` (F-A)
- `backend/services/trading_bot_service.py` (F-B + pos-cap default + effective intake gate)
- `backend/services/opportunity_evaluator.py` (F-C autonomous exposure clamp)
- `backend/services/morning_readiness_service.py` (F-E)
- `backend/scripts/audit_scalp_timeframe_tagging_v19_34_179.py` (new, F-D)
- `backend/tests/test_v19_34_179_prioritization_and_caps.py` (new, 8 tests)

### Verification
- 8/8 new unit tests pass; 52/52 existing TQS + exposure-cap tests still green.
- All five changed files compile; F-C guard import + clamp math validated.
- ⚠️ No automated agent (hardware-bound). OPERATOR LIVE-CHECK: confirm
  CRITICAL alerts get slots first; run the F-D audit; set the pos-cap env/Mongo.

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.177 PORTABLE CLOSED-TRADES FEED (foundation for pipeline tabs + V6)

### Why
Operator is planning a V5 layout change (pipeline-stage feeds as persistent
tabs) but V6 is on the horizon with a different layout philosophy. Decision:
build only the **layout-agnostic, V6-portable** pieces now and DEFER the
V5-only tab-container/layout restructure. Strict constraint: **zero impact on
the running app.**

### Shipped (fully additive)
- **Backend** `GET /api/sentcom/closed-trades?range=today|7d|30d` (new route in
  `routers/sentcom.py`). Sourced from `bot_trades`, reuses the EXACT v141 dedup
  key + flags synthetic/reconciler closes, computes a server-side summary
  (count / WR / net / ΣR / avg / worst / best). Rich rows: unified TQS grade,
  dir, shares, entry/exit price, **entry/exit time + hold duration**, realized $,
  R, MAE/MFE (R), close reason, trade type. Does NOT touch any existing route.
- **Frontend** `components/sentcom/v5/ClosedTradesTable.jsx` — portable,
  presentational, sortable rich table (data via props, emits onRowClick /
  onRangeChange). Drops into the future V5 Close tab AND V6 history view with no
  rework.
- **Frontend** `components/sentcom/preview/ClosedTradesPreview.jsx` — isolated
  harness (self-fetch + 15s live refresh) reachable ONLY at
  `?preview=closedfeed`. NOT mounted in the live tree.
- **App.js** — added the `?preview=closedfeed` escape-hatch branch (mirrors the
  existing `?preview=v6mock` pattern). Normal app render path unchanged.

### Verification
- Endpoint tested via curl across all 3 ranges: dedup confirmed (phantom NVDA
  dropped), range filtering confirmed, summary accurate. Proxy path confirmed.
- Real component renders real endpoint data in the V5 aesthetic (screenshot).
- Frontend compiles clean; lint passes. Zero changes to existing endpoints or
  the live command-center tree.

### Deferred (V5-only, pending V6 timing decision)
- Pipeline-feed tab container (HUD tiles → tabs), badge pulse, 3-column layout
  restructure, right-column → bot-stream move. Hold until operator confirms V6
  timeline (replace vs coexist).

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.176 REGIME ENGINE: COMPOSITE SPY/QQQ/IWM TREND + TOLERANCE

### Why
The `market_regime_engine.py` TrendSignalBlock (35% of the composite regime
score that drives `bot._current_regime` → position sizing + direction bias)
was **SPY-only**: it accepted `qqq_bars` but never used it, ignored IWM
entirely, and used strict boolean MA comparisons. A SPY close 0.01% under the
21-EMA flipped a 20-pt signal off, so a flat tape with green QQQ/IWM could
still print a market-wide "downtrend" — the operator's "SPY downtrend
hallucination".

NOTE: v166 (SPY 0.25% tolerance) + v167 (composite SPY/QQQ/IWM) had already
shipped on 2026-05-27, but ONLY to `realtime_technical_service.py` (per-symbol
trend classifier) and `enhanced_scanner._update_market_context` (scanner ML
context). The **regime engine that drives trading decisions was never patched**
— this is that fix.

### Fix shipped (v19.34.176)
`backend/services/market_regime_engine.py`:
- `TrendSignalBlock` is now a **weighted composite of SPY/QQQ/IWM**
  (0.5 / 0.3 / 0.2, renormalized over whatever has ≥200 bars; SPY stays the
  anchor — if SPY data is missing the block returns neutral 50).
- New `_score_index()` scores each index independently; new `_band_points()`
  applies a **±0.25% tolerance band** (price within band = half credit /
  neutral instead of a hard 0/full flip) — matches v166.
- Surfaces `index_scores`, `indexes_used`, `blend_weights`, `divergence_flag`,
  and `tolerance_pct` in `trend_block.signals` for observability. Back-compat
  SPY MA fields retained.
- `_calculate_regime()` now fetches 200 bars for QQQ + IWM (was 50 for QQQ,
  none for IWM) and passes all three to the trend block.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/market_regime_engine.py`
- `backend/tests/test_regime_composite_trend_v19_34_176.py` (new, 8 tests passing)

### Verification
- 8/8 new unit tests pass (tolerance band, per-index scoring, blend,
  divergence, SPY-hallucination fix, SPY-only fallback, missing-SPY neutral).
- Backend boots clean; `/api/market-regime/current` responds (sandbox shows
  insufficient-data branch — no IB bars locally).
- ⚠️ OPERATOR LIVE-CHECK: on a day SPY is soft but QQQ/IWM green, confirm
  `signal_blocks.trend.signals.indexes_used = [spy, qqq, iwm]` and the regime
  no longer flips to CONFIRMED_DOWN on SPY alone.

---

## 2026-05-29 — v19.34.175 TQS/SMB UNIFICATION + 5-PILLAR UI DRILL-DOWN

### Why
TQS (Trade Quality Score) is now the single source of truth for a trade's
grade. SMB grade was being read by the position-size scaler even though SMB
is already 15% of the TQS Setup pillar (double-counting), AND the operator
UI showed confusing standalone SMB/"F" grade badges.

### CRITICAL latent bug found + fixed
Audit revealed `trading_bot_service._get_trade_alerts()` manually rebuilt the
alert dict that feeds `opportunity_evaluator.evaluate_opportunity()` and
**dropped every grade/quality field** (`tqs_grade`, `tqs_score`, `smb_grade`,
`tape_score`, `risk_reward`, `smb_score_total`, `trade_style`). Consequences in
production since v19.34.156:
  • Position sizing grade resolved to **D = 0.1×** on EVERY trade (grade was
    `None` → `_resolve_grade_multiplier(None)` → D). Operator confirmed NO
    `POSITION_SIZE_GRADE_*` env overrides on the DGX — so the bot has been
    sizing every trade at **10% of intended size**.
  • The post-gate TQS recalc ran on hardcoded defaults (smb_grade="B", tape=0,
    rr=2.0) instead of real alert values.

### Fixes shipped (operator chose option A — full TQS sizing)
- **Plumb real TQS data into the alert dict** (`trading_bot_service.py`
  `_get_trade_alerts`): tqs_score/grade/action/pillar_scores/pillar_grades/
  breakdown/weights + tape_score, smb_score_total, risk_reward, trade_style,
  and smb_grade (audit-only).
- **Rewire position sizing to TQS** (`opportunity_evaluator.py` ~L840):
  `alert_grade = _post_gate_tqs_grade → tqs_grade → trade_grade`. SMB no longer
  drives sizing. Multiplier table unchanged (A=1.0/B=0.7/C=0.3/D=0.1) → A-grade
  trades now size at full 1.0× (~10× larger than the broken 0.1×).
- **`unified_grade` field** added to `BotTrade` (= TQS grade), plus `tqs_grade`/
  `tqs_score`. `smb_grade` retained for audit only. Serialized via `to_dict()`,
  hydrated on restore via the dataclass allow-list.
- **5-pillar breakdown captured** at alert time (`enhanced_scanner.
  _enrich_alert_with_tqs`) + post-gate (`opportunity_evaluator`), stored in
  `entry_context.tqs.{pillar_scores,pillar_grades,breakdown,weights,
  unified_grade}`.
- **Frontend** (`OpenPositionsV5.jsx` + new `TqsPillarPanel.jsx`): SMB grade
  badges replaced with the unified TQS grade; standalone **F**/missing grade
  chips suppressed (confused operators). New expand-on-click 5-pillar drill-down
  (Setup/Technical/Fundamental/Context/Execution) showing per-pillar score,
  grade, weight, sub-component scores + ± factor bullets.
- **DB backfill** (`backend/scripts/backfill_v19_34_175_unified_grade.py`):
  idempotent, sets `unified_grade` on historical `bot_trades` from
  entry_context.tqs → score-derived grade → quality_grade → smb_grade. Supports
  `DRY_RUN=1`.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/trading_bot_service.py` (BotTrade fields + alert-dict plumbing)
- `backend/services/opportunity_evaluator.py` (sizing rewire + unified_grade + entry_context.tqs)
- `backend/services/enhanced_scanner.py` (LiveAlert pillar fields + capture)
- `frontend/src/components/sentcom/v5/OpenPositionsV5.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/sentcom/v5/TqsPillarPanel.jsx` (new)
- `backend/scripts/backfill_v19_34_175_unified_grade.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_tqs_unification_v19_34_175.py` (new, 10 tests passing)

### Verification
- 10/10 unit tests pass. Backend compiles + `/api/tqs/*` endpoints return the
  expected 5-pillar breakdown. Frontend compiles clean. (No automated
  testing-agent — hardware-bound per AGENTS.md.)
- ⚠️ OPERATOR LIVE-CHECK NEEDED next session: confirm A-grade fills now size at
  full 1.0× (entry_context.multipliers.grade_scale = 1.0) and that the size
  jump is expected/acceptable.

## 2026-05-28 — v19.34.183/185/186 BBAI PHANTOM WHIPLASH FIX BUNDLE

### Investigation
After v181/v182 EOD fix, surfaced that ARMG and BBAI had `reconciled_external`
phantom trades on 2026-05-28. Initial hypothesis: stale GTC bracket legs from
prior sessions filling today. **Disproven** — `bot_orders` cross-session
check came back empty; IBKR statement showed both May 26 + May 27 BBAI
positions flattened cleanly.

Diagnostic scripts created (all read-only, surfaced via paste.rs):
- `/tmp/trace_orphan_origin.py` — classifies today's reconciled_* trades
  vs originating alerts; flagged 11/22 trades today with `alert_id=None`
  on `bot_trades` (separate v184 issue, deferred).
- `/tmp/verify_alert_persistence.py` — confirmed `live_alerts` IS the
  alert persistence collection (117K rows, 1989 today). Earlier
  hypothesis "alerts never persisted" was **wrong** — I was querying
  the wrong collection name. **Retracted.**
- `/tmp/bbai_origin_trace.py` — pulled full 7-day BBAI lifecycle.
- `/tmp/bbai_bracket_hunt.py` — auto-scanned every Mongo collection for
  BBAI rows, found bracket_lifecycle_events with smoking-gun error.

### Real Root Causes Found

**Cause 1 — Trade-ID Race**: Bot fires order → IB confirms fill → position
appears at IB. Reconciler runs (10-30s cadence) BEFORE the executor finishes
updating `_open_trades`. Sees IB position without matching internal record,
stamps `entered_by=reconciled_external`. Bot loses ownership of its own
trade. Evidence: `trade_audit_log` shows 25+ BBAI mean_reversion_short
intents today; `bot_trades` shows 0 as `bot_fired` and 3 as
`reconciled_external` with mangled share counts.

**Cause 2 — IB Error 110 (Variable Tick)**: Reconciler's orphan-stop math
in `position_reconciler.py:1310-1314` uses float arithmetic:
`stop_price = avg_cost - stop_distance`. For BBAI at $4.82 with 1.5%
stop, this produces $4.7477 — IB's tick grid for $1+ stocks requires
$0.01 increments, so IB returns Error 110, the `bracket_attach_governor`
permanently blocks the symbol for the day, and the phantom stays naked.
Evidence: 15+ consecutive `bracket_lifecycle_events` failures on BBAI
with `error=bracket_attach_blocked:permanent_block:ib_error_110_*`.

### Fixes Shipped

**v19.34.185 — Submit-Race Guard** (`position_reconciler.py:1259-1322`)
Before spawning a `reconciled_orphan` BotTrade for symbol X, scan
`bot._open_trades` for any trade matching X with `pre_submit_at`
within the last 60s. If found, refuse to adopt — log `submit_race_v19_34_185`
skip and let the next reconcile cycle find the trade properly
registered. Honors the v19.34.6 pre-submit stamping that was
previously ignored by the reconciler.

**v19.34.186 — Variable-Tick Rounding** (`position_reconciler.py:1377-1389`)
Added `_v186_tick_round()` after orphan-stop math. Uses Decimal +
ROUND_HALF_UP to snap stop_price + target_1 to the correct grid:
- Stock < $1.00 → $0.0001 (4 decimals)
- Stock >= $1.00 → $0.01 (2 decimals)

Both patches committed as `002b7345`. Deploy script at paste.rs/jQJ9k
(idempotent, auto-commits, auto-pushes).

**One-time data repair** (`/tmp/repair_phantom_v19_34_185.py`,
paste.rs/eNi97). Cross-references `trade_audit_log` planned trades
against `bot_trades` reconciled_external fills within ±120s and ±0.5%
price tolerance. For 2026-05-28: surfaced 6 candidates, repaired 1
(BBAI 277sh short → vwap_fade_short, audit_match=0434fb3e tight_match).
The other 5 left as-is (genuine external positions, share-count drift,
or partial-fill remnants — script conservatively requires strong evidence).

### Files Changed
- `backend/services/position_reconciler.py` (+80 lines)

### Verification Plan (2026-05-29 open)
1. 15:45 ET — EOD heartbeats fire (v181/v182 confirms)
2. Throughout session — No `submit_race_v19_34_185` adoptions of
   bot-fired trades; bot keeps ownership
3. Sub-$5 stocks — No more `ib_error_110` permanent blocks;
   brackets attach cleanly

### Still Open (Deferred to Future Sessions)
- v19.34.184 — `alert_id` stamping fix for `squeeze`, `vwap_bounce`,
  `gap_fade`, `daily_squeeze`, `pocket_pivot` paths. v19.34.36 wiring
  works for `mean_reversion_short` but bypasses these 5 setups.
  Today: 11/22 trades had `alert_id=None`.
- v19.34.187 — Defensive belt-and-suspenders cooldown
  (`_recent_executor_activity` dict) on the reconciler. Belt for v185
  if pre_submit_at isn't stamped on some new code path.
- v19.34.172 — Dual-shape timestamps (`ts` ISO + `ts_dt` BSON) on
  `bot_trades`, `alert_outcomes`, `shadow_decisions`,
  `bracket_lifecycle_events` to prevent silent 0-rows query bugs.
- v19.34.175 — TQS/SMB unification + 5-pillar UI drill-down panel
  (read-only with expand-on-click, hide SMB "F" badges).

## 2026-05-28 — v19.34.181 + v19.34.182 EOD AUTO-CLOSE RESTORED

### Trigger
EOD auto-close failed silently on 2026-05-28 — operator had to manually
flatten all positions in TWS at the close. The v169 heartbeat showed
0 entries, suggesting `check_eod_close()` was never reached. Initial
hypothesis (three early `continue`s in scan_loop: daily-loss / trading
hours / PAUSED) was wrong — diagnostic queries confirmed none had tripped.

### Real Root Cause
`/tmp/backend.log` showed 10× consecutive lines of:
```
⚠️ [TradingBot] _check_eod_close exceeded 5.0s budget — skipping this cycle
```

The `_EOD_WALL_S = 5.0` asyncio.wait_for timeout in `_scan_loop` was killing
`check_eod_close()` on every cycle. Reasons EOD needs > 5s:
- `check_position_memory_disagreement` (IB roundtrip)
- `_flatten_ghost_positions` sweep
- Parallel `asyncio.gather` of N IB close calls (~2–5s each)

TimeoutError → "skipping this cycle" → next scan → repeat. The cancellation
happened BEFORE reaching the heartbeat write at line 1209, explaining the
0-heartbeat post-mortem.

### Fixes
**v19.34.181** — Single-line bump in `services/trading_bot_service.py`:
```python
_EOD_WALL_S = 5.0  →  _EOD_WALL_S = 60.0
```
Also re-canonicalized `bot_config.eod_config` MongoDB document:
`{enabled: True, close_hour: 15, close_minute: 45}`.

**v19.34.182** — Belt + suspenders. Added dedicated `_eod_supervisor_loop()`
asyncio task spawned in `TradingBotService.start()`:
- Ticks every 15s, **independent** of `_scan_loop`.
- Calls `check_eod_close()`, `check_scalp_decay()`, `_check_eod_grading()`
  with **NO `asyncio.wait_for` wall** — EOD can take as long as it needs.
- Idempotent: scan_loop ALSO calls them (60s wall now); both paths safe
  to run concurrently via `_eod_close_executed_today` flag + grading
  per-day key.
- New 16:00 ET hard alarm: if any `close_at_eod=True` position is still
  open at 4:00 PM ET, fires a CRITICAL `sentcom_thoughts` row
  (`category="eod_post_close_alarm"`) + WS broadcast.
- Cancelled cleanly in `TradingBotService.stop()`.

### Verification
Backend restart confirmed:
```
🤖 [TradingBot] Scan loop started - interval: 30s
🛡️  [TradingBot] v19.34.182 EOD supervisor started (15s cadence, no wait_for wall)
```

### Files Changed
- `backend/services/trading_bot_service.py` (v181 sed + v182 patch)
- `bot_config.eod_config` MongoDB document (canonical 15:45)

### Operational Notes
- Per `AGENTS.md`, backend restart uses `./start_backend.sh --force` (not
  supervisorctl). The Windows `.bat` runs `git checkout -- .` on the DGX,
  so v182's deploy script auto-commits + pushes immediately.
- Diagnostic script saved at `/tmp/eod_diag.py` for future post-mortems.

## 2026-05-28 — v19.34.170 Timestamp normalization + Fundamentals reconnect

### Trigger
Two recurring stability issues identified in the v169 handoff:

1. **Timestamp type drift across DB collections** — `bot_trades`,
   `alert_outcomes`, `shadow_decisions` write ISO strings;
   `bracket_lifecycle_events` and `_persist_thought` writes use BSON
   datetimes. The v169 EOD heartbeat wrote `created_at` as an ISO
   string, which broke the `created_at` TTL index on `sentcom_thoughts`
   AND made the row invisible to `routers/diagnostics.py` queries that
   filter on `timestamp` (ISO). Cross-collection queries returned 0
   rows silently — a known cause of "phantom" debugging sessions.

2. **Fundamentals "Not connected to IB" log spam** —
   `TradeContextService._capture_fundamental_context` unconditionally
   called `ib_service.get_fundamentals(symbol)` which raises
   `ConnectionError` whenever the direct ib_insync worker is stale
   (most of the time on this DGX install, since live data uses the IB
   pusher RPC path). Each evaluated alert logged a WARN and left the
   `FundamentalContext` empty.

### Fix
- **`backend/utils/timestamps.py`** — new module exposing `now_iso`,
  `now_bson`, `parse_to_bson`, `parse_to_iso`, `stamps`, `epoch_ms`.
  Canonical convention going forward: new collections write BOTH a
  `ts` ISO string AND a `ts_dt` BSON datetime so either query shape
  succeeds. Existing collections keep their current shape but
  consumers use `parse_to_bson`/`parse_to_iso` to coerce input.
- **`services/position_manager.py` EOD heartbeat** — rewritten to the
  canonical `sentcom_thoughts` schema: `kind="system"`, `content`,
  ISO `timestamp` (so `routers/diagnostics.py` queries see it), BSON
  `created_at` (so the TTL index actually expires it after 7d). Keeps
  top-level `category="eod_heartbeat"` so the operator's existing
  `db.sentcom_thoughts.find({category:'eod_heartbeat'})` query shape
  from v169 still works.
- **`services/trade_context_service.py`** — gate the IB fundamentals
  call behind `ib_service.get_connection_status()` and fall back to
  the Finnhub-backed `FundamentalDataService` when the direct IB
  worker reports disconnected. Earnings proximity lookup is now
  independent of either upstream.

### Test
- `tests/test_v19_34_170_timestamps_and_fundamentals.py` — 12 tests:
  timestamp parse/round-trip, fundamentals fallback hits Finnhub when
  IB is down, no IB call when disconnected, IB path is preferred when
  connected, static guard against the EOD heartbeat regressing to ISO
  `created_at`. All 12 pass. Regression suite (v164/v165/v168.1/v169
  = 54 tests) all still green.

### Deployment notes
- No DB migration needed — change is forward-compatible.
- After the next DGX backend restart, new `sentcom_thoughts` rows for
  EOD heartbeats will have the new schema. Old v169-shape rows TTL out
  in 7d.

## 2026-05-28 — v19.34.169 Pre-market sizing+EOD observability

### Trigger
Operator report: small share sizes on POSITION-tier setups (e.g. ALAB
1 share, ASTS 3 shares); and EOD scheduler appeared silent yesterday,
requiring ~13 manual TWS closes. Diagnosed root causes:

1. **Sizing**: `rs_leader_break`, `accumulation_entry`, `power_trend_stack`,
   `stage_2_breakout` use 2.5-3.0× ATR multipliers. On high-priced
   volatile names this yields 12-14% raw stop distances, which
   combined with the fixed risk_per_trade budget collapsed share
   counts to 1-3. POSITION-tier setups are multi-day holds by design
   (`close_at_eod=False`); their stops were tuned for swing R:R, not
   intraday risk envelopes.

2. **EOD silence**: `_check_eod_close` IS wired into the scan loop
   (`trading_bot_service.py:3907`, with a wall-time budget) and
   `_eod_close_enabled=True` at init. But EOD state lives only
   in-memory on the `TradingBotService` instance — no DB
   audit trail. Yesterday's `/tmp/backend.log` was truncated by the
   morning restart, so we can't retrospectively prove what fired.
   The 11 filled positions all closed via `oca_closed_externally_v19_31`
   — the bot's catch-all when IB shows position vanished without
   bot-initiated close. That reason fires for BOTH IB OCA brackets
   AND operator-initiated TWS manual closes (the bot can't distinguish).

### Fix
- **`opportunity_evaluator.calculate_atr_based_stop`** — cap stop
  distance at 5% of entry for ATR multipliers ≥ 2.5 (INVESTMENT and
  POSITION horizons). Operator-tunable via env
  `MAX_STOP_PCT_INVESTMENT` / `MAX_STOP_PCT_POSITION`. Scalps and
  intraday setups unchanged. Cap NEVER widens an already-tight stop.
- **`position_manager.check_eod_close`** — write a `sentcom_thoughts`
  row (category=`eod_heartbeat`) once per minute inside the EOD
  window so the operator can SEE the scheduler firing from the UI
  even when no positions are eligible to close. Dedupes per HH:MM.
- **`start_backend.sh`** — archive `/tmp/backend.log` to
  `logs/backend_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` before each restart, with 30-day
  retention. Prevents future "where did yesterday's evidence go" gaps.

### Tests (`backend/tests/test_v19_34_169_stop_cap.py`)
- 8/8 passing: ALAB 5% cap, stage_2_breakout 5% cap (3.0× mult),
  accumulation_entry 5% cap (2.5× mult), intraday breakout NOT capped,
  9_ema_scalp NOT capped, env override (`MAX_STOP_PCT_POSITION=0.07`),
  already-tight stop preserved, short-side symmetry.

### Verified live on DGX
- POSITION-tier sizing: deployed via `backend/scripts/deploy_v19_34_169.py`.
  Restart confirmed; first qualifying trade will show stop_pct ≤ 5%.
- Log archive: `→ archived /tmp/backend.log → logs/backend_20260528_093341.log
  (702099 bytes)` on first restart.
- EOD heartbeat: deferred verification to today's 19:45-20:00 UTC
  window (operator to query `sentcom_thoughts` for category=eod_heartbeat).

### Known follow-ups
- EOD bug NOT confirmed-fixed yet — heartbeat is the diagnostic.
  Action item for tonight: query for `category=eod_heartbeat` after
  the close. If heartbeats fire but no closes go out for
  `close_at_eod=True` positions, the bug is downstream in the
  flatten path. If no heartbeats at all, the scan loop isn't reaching
  EOD code (timeout, wedged loop, etc.).
- `bot._eod_close_executed_today` flag is in-memory only — needs DB
  persistence so a mid-day crash doesn't repeat EOD.


## 2026-05-27 — v19.34.168.1 Composite regime history+stats routing fix

### Trigger
v168 added `/api/market-regime/history` + `/api/market-regime/stats`
endpoints as bare `@app.get(...)` decorators in `server.py`. Both
collided with the existing daily Engine A router (`routers/market_regime.py`
mounted at prefix `/api/market-regime`): `/history` was shadowed
(returned daily Engine A's `market_regime_state` rows instead of intraday
snapshots) and `/stats` returned 404.

### Fix
- Renamed the new intraday endpoints to live under the `composite/`
  namespace established by v167.1:
  - `GET /api/market-regime/composite/history` → reads `regime_snapshots`
  - `GET /api/market-regime/composite/stats` → % time-in-regime over N hours
- Both endpoints registered next to the working `/api/market-regime/composite`
  route at the end of `server.py` so binding is deterministic.
- Daily Engine A `/api/market-regime/history` still serves `market_regime_state`
  (no collision, verified via regression curl).
- `backend/services/regime_persistence_service.py` shipped with TTL=30d index,
  in-process change detection, history + stats query helpers.
- Idempotent deploy script `backend/scripts/deploy_v19_34_168_1.py`:
  strips any prior broken `@app.get("/api/market-regime/history")` /
  `/stats` decorators before injecting the new routes.

### Tests (`backend/tests/test_v19_34_168_1_endpoint_routing.py`)
- 8/8 passing: change-detection, divergence-flip persistence, history
  filter window, stats % calculation, empty-DB handling, and
  `server.py` namespace verification.

### Verified live on DGX
- `composite/history?hours=6` → `success:true, source:"regime_snapshots"`
- `composite/stats?hours=6` → `success:true, "no snapshots in window"`
  (correct — collection only populates on regime/agreement/divergence flips)
- `history?days=30` → still returns Engine A composite_score data (no regression)


## 2026-05-27 — v19.34.167 Composite SPY/QQQ/IWM market regime classifier

### Trigger
v166 fixed the SPY trend classifier but the SCANNER's regime gating
(`enhanced_scanner._update_market_context`) was still SPY-only — blind
to QQQ/IWM divergence. A clean uptrend in SPY+QQQ with IWM breaking
down would tag the market STRONG_UPTREND and let `9_ema_scalp` fire
into a small-cap-led reversal.

### Architecture decision
Audited the three existing regime layers (`MarketRegimeEngine` daily,
`enhanced_scanner._update_market_context` intraday, `realtime_technical_service.trend`
per-symbol kernel) — kept them separate (different timeframes) and
extended layer 2 to vote across the broad indexes using the layer 3
kernel as the per-index probe. No new infrastructure.

### Patch (`backend/services/enhanced_scanner.py`)
1. **`_update_market_context`** rewritten to `asyncio.gather` SPY+QQQ+IWM
   snapshots in parallel, then delegate to a pure classifier.
2. **`_classify_market_regime(spy, qqq, iwm)`** — new pure method:
   - VOLATILE if max daily_range_pct across valid indexes > 2.0
   - Unanimous (3/3) up + 3/3 above VWAP + EMA9 → STRONG_UPTREND
     (or MOMENTUM if SPY rsi > 60)
   - Unanimous (3/3) down + 3/3 not above VWAP → STRONG_DOWNTREND
   - Majority (2/3) up + 2/3 VWAP support → MOMENTUM (degraded)
   - Majority (2/3) down → FADE (degraded)
   - Mixed/no majority → RANGE_BOUND (or FADE if SPY quiet + extreme RSI)
3. **Single-index fallback** replays v166 logic verbatim if QQQ/IWM
   unavailable.
4. **`self._market_data`** new attribute exposing `indices_valid`,
   `index_agreement` (unanimous_up/down, majority_up/down, mixed),
   `divergence_flag`, `uptrend_votes`, `downtrend_votes`,
   `max_daily_range_pct`, and `per_index: {spy, qqq, iwm}` breakdown.
5. `self._spy_data` retained for backwards compat with downstream consumers.

### Tests — `backend/tests/test_market_regime_composite_v19_34_167.py`
14/14 passing on DGX:
- Unanimous up (clean / overbought)
- Unanimous down
- Small-cap divergence (SPY+QQQ up, IWM down) → MOMENTUM
- Tech divergence (majority down) → FADE
- 1-1-1 split → RANGE_BOUND
- VOLATILE override (IWM > 2% range)
- 2% boundary not VOLATILE (strict >)
- Single-index degraded mode (3 variants)
- Metadata structure sanity
- v166 audit case regression: must NOT classify STRONG_DOWNTREND

### Deploy
Single-line 12,904-char base64 paste (after chunked approach broke
when chat collapsed newlines). Pre/post SHA verified.

### Verification
- Pre: `73991b86facdc3e1...` → Post: `0bdbb7a97c6a78f7...` ✅
- New backend PID 3757239 serving on :8001 ✅
- Backup retained: `enhanced_scanner.py.pre_v167.bak`

### Watch next
- Scanner ticks emit new alerts with composite regime + divergence flag
- Setups that were silenced by false STRONG_DOWNTREND tags should
  start firing during clean uptrend / sideways regimes

## 2026-05-27 — v19.34.166 Trend classifier tolerance + macro-context veto

### Trigger
After v19.34.165 unlocked 5 momentum setups, the audit found that ~80% of
live alerts on a +0.48% SPY gap-up day were being tagged
`strong_downtrend` by `realtime_technical_service.get_technical_snapshot`.
SPY at 749.19 (EMA9=749.26, EMA20=749.65, EMA50=698.44, SMA200=698.44)
was classified "downtrend" because the original logic at L596-602 used
strict binary `>` vs EMA9/EMA20 — a 7-cent intraday print below EMA9
flipped the classification despite price sitting 7% above EMA50 and the
secular structure being a clean uptrend. The misclass poisoned every
setup gate that requires `trend == "uptrend"` (incl. `9_ema_scalp`,
dormant since 2026-04-07).

### Patch (`backend/services/realtime_technical_service.py` L593-643)
1. **Tolerance band — 0.25%** (`_TREND_TOLERANCE_PCT`). Distances within
   ±0.25% of an EMA count as "at" — neither above nor below — so noise-
   level prints don't flip uptrend↔downtrend tick-by-tick.
2. **Macro-context veto**. If price > EMA50 AND EMA50 > SMA200 (secular
   uptrend structure), the classifier may NEVER return "downtrend".

### Tests — `backend/tests/test_trend_classifier_v19_34_166.py`
9/9 passing.

### Verification
- pre `f38efa1ac07888a3...` → post `afba82a9db7bfa60...` ✅
- Live SPY trend went from "downtrend" → "sideways" at price=749.46,
  dist_from_ema9=-0.01%
