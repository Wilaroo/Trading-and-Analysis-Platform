# TradeCommand / SentCom — Product Requirements

> Lean, static spec. Dated work history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`.
> Open priorities and backlog live in `ROADMAP.md`.
>
> **Rules for the agent (keep these docs alive):**
>   - Ship something → prepend a `## YYYY-MM-DD — <title> — SHIPPED`
>     section to **CHANGELOG.md** (Why / Scope / Verification).
>   - Priority shifts → reorder **ROADMAP.md**; promoted item moves up,
>     completed item is removed and recorded in CHANGELOG.
>   - Architecture / API contract / hardware topology changes → edit
>     **PRD.md** (this file).
>   - Never silently drop history; never let `🔴 Now / Near-term` go
>     stale across more than one task.

## Original problem statement
AI trading platform running across DGX Spark (Linux) + Windows PC (IB Gateway). Goal: stable massive training pipeline, real-time responsive UI, SentCom chat aware of live portfolio status without hanging the backend, and a bot that can go live for automated trading with accurate dashboards.


## Architecture
- **DGX Spark (Linux, 192.168.50.2)**: Backend FastAPI :8001, Chat :8002, MongoDB :27017, Frontend React :3000, Ollama :11434, worker, Blackwell GPU
- **Windows PC (192.168.50.1)**: IB Gateway :4002, IB Data Pusher (client 15), 4 Turbo Collectors (clients 16–19)
- Orders flow: Spark backend `/api/ib/orders/queue` → Mongo `order_queue` → Windows pusher polls `/api/ib/orders/pending` → submits to IB → reports via `/api/ib/orders/result`
- Position/quotes flow: IB Gateway → pusher → `POST /api/ib/push-data` → in-memory `_pushed_ib_data` (+ Mongo snapshot for chat_server)




## Key API surface
- `GET /api/portfolio` — IB pushed positions + manual fallback; quote_ready guard
- `POST /api/portfolio/flatten-paper?confirm=FLATTEN` — flatten paper account, 120s cooldown
- `GET /api/assistant/coach/morning-briefing` — Setup-landscape + multi-index-regime grounded morning briefing in 1st-person voice (2026-04-30 v4)
- `GET /api/assistant/coach/eod-briefing` — retrospective EOD coaching (2026-04-29 v3)
- `GET /api/assistant/coach/weekend-prep-briefing` — Sunday-night prep (2026-04-29 v3)
- `GET /api/scanner/setup-landscape?context=morning|midday|eod|weekend` — universe-wide Bellafiore-Setup snapshot + 1st-person narrative (now leads with multi-index regime line — 2026-04-30 v4)
- `GET /api/scanner/setup-trade-matrix` — full Trade × Setup matrix + classifier stats (2026-04-29 v2)
- `GET /api/scanner/setup-coverage` — orphan/silent/active/time-filtered diagnostic
- `GET /api/scanner/detector-stats` — per-detector evals + hits (cumulative + cycle)
- `GET /api/ai-modules/validation/summary` — promotion-rate dashboard
- `POST /api/ib/push-data` — receive pusher snapshot
- `GET /api/ib/orders/pending` — pusher polls this
- `POST /api/ib/orders/claim/{id}`, `POST /api/ib/orders/result` — claim/complete hooks pusher should use but may not
- `POST /api/ai-modules/shadow/track-outcomes?drain=true&batch_size=50` — drain shadow-decision backlog (added 2026-04-29). Yields to event loop between batches.


## Pipeline architecture (Bellafiore + ML hybrid)

### Conceptual hierarchy (operator mental model + UI)
`Market Regime (SPY/QQQ/IWM/DIA) → Sector Regime → Daily Setup → Time/In-play → Trade`

### Runtime architecture (decided 2026-04-29 evening, locked 2026-04-30)
**Hard gates only in 3 places** to avoid compounding rejection rate
that would starve the ML pipeline of training data:
  1. **Time-window** (`_is_setup_valid_now` in `enhanced_scanner.py`) — opening_drive can't fire midday
  2. **In-Play / Universe** — ADV / spread / halt
  3. **Confidence gate** — predicted_R + win_prob threshold

**Everything else flows in as features** to the per-Trade ML models:
  - **Multi-index regime tag** (`MultiIndexRegimeClassifier` —
    shipped 2026-04-30) — composite SPY/QQQ/IWM/DIA label, 8 active
    buckets + UNKNOWN; one-hot encoded into `regime_label_*` features.
  - Sector regime tag (planned next session — `SectorRegimeClassifier`)
  - Daily Setup tag (`MarketSetupClassifier` — shipped 2026-04-29 v2;
    one-hot encoded into `setup_label_*` features 2026-04-30)
  - Setup × Trade matrix context (`is_countertrend`, `out_of_context_warning`, `experimental` — shipped 2026-04-29 v2)
  - Setup landscape (`SetupLandscapeService` — shipped 2026-04-29 v3;
    extended with regime line 2026-04-30)
  - Numerical regime features (24 floats — `regime_features.py`,
    SPY/QQQ/IWM trend/RSI/momentum/breadth/correlations/rotations)

`STRATEGY_REGIME_PREFERENCES` in `enhanced_scanner.py` is METADATA
ONLY — explicitly NOT a hard-gate enforcement (re-documented
2026-04-30 to close the next-session-plan item #6). It documents the
operator's mental model of which trades thrive in which regimes; the
actual learning happens via the one-hot features above.

The matrix in `services/market_setup_classifier.py::TRADE_SETUP_MATRIX`
is the operator's source of truth for which Trade fits which Setup;
`/app/memory/SETUPS_AND_TRADES.md` is the human-readable mirror.

## Hardware runtime notes
- Can't test this codebase in the Emergent container (no IB, no pusher, no GPU). All verification is curl/python on the user's Spark. Testing agents unavailable for integration flows.
- Code changes reach Spark via "Save to Github" → `git pull` on both Windows and Spark.
- Backend restart: `pkill -f "python server.py" && cd backend && nohup python server.py > /tmp/backend.log 2>&1 &` (Spark uses `.venv`, not supervisor)
